Stage of phar￾macokinetic modeling,Data utilized,Modeling activities
Stage 1,ManNAc single dose pharmacokinetic data (Study 12-HG￾0207),Design of structural pharmacokinetic model Explore absorption models
Stage 2,ManNAc BID pharmacokinetic data (Study 15-HG-0068),Covariate analysis Determination of non-linear and stationary pharmacokinetic
Stage 3,Stage 2 population pharmacokinetic model for ManNAc and Neu5Ac,Monte Carlo simulations of dosing regimens Recommendation for evaluation of additional TID dosing regimens in an extension of Study 15-HG-0068
Stage 4,"All available data, including the additional TID dosing phar￾macokinetic data generated during extension conducted in same patients from Study 15-HG-0068",Finalize pharmacokinetic model
